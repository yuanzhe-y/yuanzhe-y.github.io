Impure simplicial complexes are a powerful tool to model multi-agent epistemic situations whereagents may die, but it is difficult to define a satisfactory semantics for the ordinary propositionalmodal language on such models, since many conceptually dubious expressions involving dead agentscan be expressed in this language. In this paper, we introduce a term-modal language with assignmentoperators, in which such conceptually dubious expressions are syntactically excluded. We define both simplicial semantics and first-order Kripke semantics for this language, characterize their respectiveexpressivity through notions of bisimulation, and show that the two semantics are equivalent whenwe consider a special class of first-order Kripke models called local epistemic models. We also offera complete axiomatization for the epistemic logic based on this language, and show that our languagehas a notion of assignment normal form. Finally, we discuss the behavior of a kind of intensionaldistributed knowledge that can be naturally expressed in our language.
