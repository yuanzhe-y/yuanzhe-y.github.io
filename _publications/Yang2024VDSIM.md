In studies of first-order modal logic (FOML), in order to give a semantics on varying-domain models, we usually use free logic. However, we can also keep the classical first-order logic, but revise the semantics of the modal operator instead, as shown in works on the so-called "common sense predicate modal logic". In this paper, following the latter approach, we introduce a binary strict implication operator ϕ ⇛ ψ, which is more expressive than the common sense 2-operator, and is able to characterize a lot of our reasoning about necessity (or time, knowledge, etc.) in natural language that involves existence and non-existence of objects. We offer complete axiomatizations of the FOML of ⇛ on the class of all varying-domain models, the class of symmetric models, as well as the class of transitive models with a special property we call the "continual existence property".
