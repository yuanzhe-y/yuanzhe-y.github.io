We offer a complete axiomatization of two-agent social friendly coalition logic proposed by Goranko and Enqvist (2018), show its decidability and finite model property, and generalize the results to cases where there can be aribitrarily many agents, but the language only talks about a well-structured set of coalitions. We also show that the same axiomatization is incomplete when there are three agents but the coalition set is not well-structured.
