Coalition logic, initiated by Pauly (2001,2002), studies the actions of coalitions of agents under multi-agent settings. Recently, Goranko and Enqvist (2018) proposed a new kind of coalition logic called “social friendly coalition logic (SFCL)”, which employs operators that resembles the operators of instantial neighborhood modal logic (van Benthem et al. (2017)). They proposed an axiomatization of SFCL in their paper, but they later discovered that their completeness proof is erroneous. In this talk, we offer a complete axiomatization for two-agent SFCL, and we generalize this result to cases where there can be aribitrarily many agents, but the language only talks about a well-structured set of coalitions. We also show that the resulting logic is decidable and has finite model property. As for SFCL with more than two agents and unrestricted coalitions, the axiomatization remains open, but we provide two valid formulas that are not deducible in the present axiomatization, showing that a stronger axiomatization is required.
